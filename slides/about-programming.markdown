## What's a Program?

### Here's One!

### A Quick Exercise
<aside>
What do you think this program does?  Try walking through it line-by-line. &rarr;
</aside>
<div class="incremental" markdown="block">
<p>This program prints out photo posts from tumblr that have at least two tags, with "cat" as one of those tags.</p>
<aside>
Let's try running it (hopefully looking for cats is a sufficiently benign search!). &rarr;
</aside>
<p>(You can try this out too if you have your laptop and can follow along)</p>
<aside>
Based on this example, describe what a program is. &rarr;
</aside>
<p>One simple description might be: a set of instructions that tell the computer to do things.</p>

### A Formal Definition
__program__ - a sequence of instructions that specifies to a computer actions and computations to be performed

## This is About _Programming_, not Just Programs
<aside>So... what's programming?</aside>
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Programming

* writing a program (of course!)
* all of the ancillary processes involved in writing that program
	* designing / planning / requirements
	* testing
	* debugging
	* refactoring (changing code) 
</section>

<section markdown="block">
### Programming Can Be:

* Engineering (software engineering)
	* Precise and exacting
	* Provable and formally verifiable
* A craft  (creative coding)
	* Creative and iterative process
	* Expertise built through experience
* A science (computer science)
	* The study of information processing and computation 
	* Related to mathematics and philsophy

## But It's Really Just Problem Solving

### Why Would You Want to Learn How to Program?
<aside>
Some motivation...
</aside>
* I'm going to be the next [Ada Lovelace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace#First_computer_program), or [Notch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notch_(game_designer))
* I'm obsessive about my [spreadsheets](http://cdn.twentytwowords.com/wp-content/uploads/Batman-in-Microsoft-Excel.png); I need to get that formula/conditional formatting to work! 
* I'm managing a bunch of nerdy programmers; we need to figure out how to talk to each other.
* Technology is the art medium of the future; I'm going to be the next [Cory](http://www.coryarcangel.com/things-i-made/supermarioclouds/) [Arcangel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Arcangel)!
